I want to build a fully responsive, hacker-inspired portfolio website with a dark cyberpunk aesthetic. The website should have glowing neon elements (red, purple, green), smooth animations, and interactive elements for a futuristic, high-tech look.

🔍 Problem & Purpose:
The goal is to showcase my coding projects and skills in a visually stunning, futuristic portfolio. It should stand out from traditional portfolios with immersive animations, glitch effects, and a deep cyber theme.

🎯 Features & Functionality:
🔹 Hero Section (First Impression Matters!)
Large glitch-effect name: "Arnav Barway"

Subtitle: "Dark Web Sorcerer", styled with a typewriter effect

Glowing ‘Hire Me’ button with pulsating hover effect

(Optional) 3D Parallax effect for a dynamic feel

🔹 About Me Section (Hacker Vibes)
Cyber/hacker-style font (Orbitron or VT323)

Glitch-hover animation on text

Glassmorphism-style card for a sleek look

🔹 Skills Section (Interactive Animations)
Animated skill icons (JavaScript, Python, Web Dev, Security)

Hover effect: Icons glow red/purple/green

🔹 Portfolio Section (Showcase of My Work)
Dynamic project grid layout

Each project card should include:
✅ Screenshot
✅ Short description
✅ Hover effect: Glitch/neon glow
✅ Click to open modal or GitHub link

🔹 Contact Section (Cyberpunk UI)
Dark-themed glowing input fields

Animated placeholders that react when typing

A ‘Send Message’ button that pulsates on hover

(Optional) Terminal-style form submission animation

🎨 Design & UI Preferences:
✅ Always Dark Mode – Deep black backgrounds (#0a0a0a)
✅ Glowing neon UI elements (Red/Purple/Green)
✅ Smooth hover & page transitions (GSAP or Anime.js)
✅ Floating cyberpunk particles.js for an immersive effect
✅ Glitch hover effects on buttons & images
✅ (Optional) Matrix-like animated background

🛠️ Preferred Tech Stack:
Frontend: HTML + CSS (Tailwind or SCSS) + JavaScript

Animations: GSAP or Anime.js

Fonts: Orbitron / VT323 for a futuristic look

Icons: FontAwesome or Lucide icons

✅ Final Goal:
✔️ Fully responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop
✔️ Smooth animations & immersive cyber aesthetics
✔️ Well-structured code (clean, modular, and easy to edit)
✔️ Visually stunning hacker-style portfolio with modern UX/UI
